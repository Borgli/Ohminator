Step-by-step guide on how to upload an intro:
Step 1: Find a suitable intro. The file format must be .wav or .mp3.
        Audio length should be no less than 3 seconds and no more than 10 seconds. The sweet spot is 5-6 seconds.
Step 2: Click the "upload file button" in Discord in any channel belonging to the server you want your intro to play in,
        and upload the file you want to play as your intro. Intros are server specific. You can alternatively
        drag the file you want directly into the channel.
Step 3: You will be prompted by Discord if you want to add an optional comment with your upload. This is where you
        write the upload command, !upload, and click upload.
If successful the bot should reply that the upload was successful. If not successful, try each step again or
try changing the file.
